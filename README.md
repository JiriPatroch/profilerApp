# Profiler App

## About

My first project in React JS. This project is not connected to any persistent layer, as database for storing "purchase" orders and cutting plans it uses local storage. By this project I have learned basics about using React front-end library and this library really catched me.. 


### Features

    1. CRUD (plans "purchase" order)
    2. Show standard profile catalog (custom pagination and items per page func.)
    3. Create cutting plan from "purchase" order (incomplete)
    4. Show "purchase" order sumarization
    5. Create downloadable PDF with Sumarization (incomplete)
